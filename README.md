FrameBase is a linked open knowledge base meant to uniformly
represent a wide range of knowledge, tackling semantic heterogeneity
among various sources of structured knowledge, such as the ones in
the Linked Open Data cloud. It provides a flexible and uniform way of
capturing n-ary relationships by adapting and combining repositories
of frames from the fields of linguistics and cognitive science
(FrameNet and WordNet) to establish a large and wide-coverage
vocabulary that can be used to represent complex knowledge and
extended with more specific elements. In other words: if you can
express it with language, you can express it with FrameBase â€”barring
some very specific concepts that need to be coined or imported from
domain-specific KBs.
